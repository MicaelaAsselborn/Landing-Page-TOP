# Landing-Page-TOP

I started this project thinking this was gonna be quite the easy task since I had done a landing page before, but this proved to be quite the challenge actually, it took me more hours than I thought I was gonna need. I am very happy with the result tho. 

I did came into a couple problems that I couldn't figure out before, but now with some of the knowledge built into the module I could easily solve, like centering elements after you change a flex main axis.

This only proved to me that I need to build more websites and keep practicing more. I need practice practice practice!
